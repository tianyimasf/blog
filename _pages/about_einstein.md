I'm currently a second-year applied mathematics master's student at University of Colorado at Boulder. I'm interested in apply geospatial foundational model, Graph Neural Network (GNN) and CNN to biodiversity conservation projects. I value multimodal datasets beyond imageries, including sensor, drone, unmanned vehicle and audio recordings, and other data like satellite images and bioclimate variables. 

My secondary interests include emmergent art and technology, software engineering and startups. Before starting grad school, I worked at Scale AI for a year and extended their payout system to automatically price data labeling tasks for annotators. I served oncall sessions and solved a platform-wide bug and several system-wide bug across labeling tasks searching and routing, and annotator payout calculation. Before that, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Rochester at upper state New York, where I met lovely friends and had many good memories. Nowadays you can find me playing games, my keyboard, reading and going to the gym.
