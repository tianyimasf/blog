I'm currently a second-year applied mathematics master's student at University of Colorado at Boulder. I'm interested in apply **geospatial foundation model, Graph Neural Network (GNN) and CNN** to biodiversity conservation projects. I value **multimodal datasets** beyond imageries, including sensor, drone, unmanned vehicle and audio recordings, and other data like satellite images and bioclimate variables.

My secondary interests include **emergent art and technology, software engineering and startups**. Before starting grad school, I worked at Scale AI for a year and extended their payout system to automatically price data labeling tasks for annotators. I served oncall sessions and solved a platform-wide bug and several system-wide bugs across labeling tasks searching and routing, and annotator payout calculation. Before that, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Rochester at upper state New York, where I met lovely friends and had many good memories. Nowadays you can find me playing games (Overwatch etc.), my keyboard, reading and going to the gym.
